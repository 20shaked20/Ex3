### Introduction
This repository is part of an assigment in 'C' programming course at Ariel University.
>
The project is about Strings in 'c', with the usage of dynamic memory allocation.

# The project:
This project consists 3 parts:
> Minimal Requrrence: alphabet is in the start & end location of a string, inside it does not effect the word, meaning we need to consider them as 0\blanks.
## Part1 -> Gematria Sequences:
 - Given a word&TXT , find all the minimal requrrences of the word in the text that has the same gematria sum while. ( i'e 1-26 as english alphabet )

## Part2 -> Atbash Sequences:
 - Given a word&TXT, find all the minimal requrrences of the 'ATBASH' ciper from our word in the text, and in its reversed form.

## Part3 -> Anagram Sequences:
 - Given a word&TXT, find all the minial requrrences of the 'Anagram' strings that relate to our word in the text.

## Testing:
Using the makefile, in the command line type "make all" it will automaticlly create an exectuable file.
>
in the command line type "./stringProg" and the program will start running.
>
insert a word with the ending of empty space (i,e '\n' '\t' ' ' ... )
insert a txt with the ending of '~'
